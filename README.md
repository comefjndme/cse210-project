# Tank Wars 

Tank Wars is the remake of the famous artillery game in retro pixel graphics!
Your goal is to destroy the enemy tanks by careful calibration of your next shot.
The game is easy to learn but hard to master.

```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 tank-wars
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
